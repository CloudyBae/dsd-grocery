# Zest: Spritz Up Your Meals


Zest is a grocery management tool with built-in ingredient tracker, recipe integration, and macro calculator.

Zest will analyze the groceries you have on hand, help build out a shopping list for meal prepping, and give a detailed list of macros such as protein, carbs, etc. If a user enters items they have in the fridge, Zest can generate a list of recipes based on those ingredients.
